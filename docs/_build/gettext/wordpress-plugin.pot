msgid "Misinformation is a very complex phenomenon. Mediaâ€™s credibility has lessened because of questionable practices like stealth editions. This plug-in would help media outlets to be accountable to their audiences. We believe that using the plug-in could be seen as a commitment to open the newsrooms to public scrutiny, by using something that could be easily installed by everyone."

msgid "Besides, misinformation is an alarming situation in Latin America, where media companies are not used to follow nor enforce rigorous editorial policies.

Also we would like to draft a protocol RFC to publish newsdiffs to subscribed peers. The plug-in could also be integrated with other tools and potentially implemented other CMS platforms by following the standard."
