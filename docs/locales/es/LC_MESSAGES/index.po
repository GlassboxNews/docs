"We want to create a protocol in order to provide a *View History* "
"function on published news. With this tool, people would be able to see "
"how content has been modified, even subscribing (via RSS) to a specific "
"note. Ideally, this plug-in would be integrated in a tool used at large "
"scale like Wordpress and potentially distributed in Wordpress Plugin "
"format."

"The application of this tool is inspired by Wikipedia's View History "
"functionality. In Latin America, editorial guidelines are lax, even in "
"large, well-established media. Newsrooms edit content without notifying "
"their audiences about the changes, and some of these editions severely "
"modify the framing of the news. While some editions may be easily "
"discarded as corrections, others should be disclosed to the public. "
"Allowing the people to oversee these changes may also help to crowdsource"
" the fight against misinformation, as Wikipedia’s collective intelligence"
" has shown."

"One of the biggest lessons from Wikipedia is that knowledge is a social "
"construction. News are too: they are susceptible to bias, manipulation, "
"and private interests. There’s nothing inherently wrong with editing – as"
" a matter of fact, is one of the advantages of digital journalism. But it"
" is different to update a text than changing a source, or adding "
"multimedia content to offer context than removing information. "
"Credibility and openness are intimately related, and newsrooms can learn "
"from Wikipedia’s best practices."
