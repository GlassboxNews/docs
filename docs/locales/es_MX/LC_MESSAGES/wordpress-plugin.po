"Misinformation is a very complex phenomenon. Mediaâ€™s credibility has "
"lessened because of questionable practices like stealth editions. This "

" believe that using the plug-in could be seen as a commitment to open the"
" newsrooms to public scrutiny, by using something that could be easily "
"installed by everyone."

"Besides, misinformation is an alarming situation in Latin America, where "

"to strengthen reliability and credibility."

"and potentially be used with other CMS platforms by following the "
"protocol."
